        "**Question-1)** What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "** Answer-1)**Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its clear syntax, which is similar to the English language, making it easy to write and understand. It supports multiple programming paradigms like: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Procedural Programming, Functional Programming. Python is open-source and runs on many platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is popular beacuse due to several key reasons:\n",
        "1. Simple and Readable Syntax\n",
        "2. Versatility\n",

        "4. Extensive Libraries and Frameworks\n",

        "**Question-2)** What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer-2)** An interpreter in Python is a program that reads, translates, and executes Python code line by line, without needing to compile the entire program into machine code first. It reads, analyzes, and executes the code, providing immediate feedback. This makes Python an interpreted language, contrasting with compiled languages where the entire code is translated before execution."

They are integral to the syntax and structure of Python and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) by the programmer. Example- if, else, elif, def, return, class, break, continue etc"

        "Tuples are immutable because they are meant to store fixed data that should not be changed, ensuring data safety and allowing faster performance.\n",
